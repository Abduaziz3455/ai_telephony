# üìû AI Telephony Project

Welcome to the **AI Telephony Project**! This cutting-edge system automates customer interactions using AI-powered telephony, enabling efficient and intelligent communication for businesses. Built with FreeSWITCH, Lua scripting, and Python, this project delivers dynamic call handling, real-time audio analysis, and error-resilient operations.

## üåü Key Features

- **SIP Calling Integration**: Seamlessly handle SIP calls with FreeSWITCH and Lua scripting.
- **AI-Driven Audio Analysis**: Utilize Python scripts with a speech recognition library and GPT models to analyze and interpret user responses during calls.
- **Dynamic Call Flow**: Handle call processes with intelligent conditions, including custom logic for specific scenarios.
- **Error-Resilient Design**: Implement robust error handling to ensure smooth and reliable operations, breaking loops as needed.

## üöÄ Project Structure

- **Lua Scripts**: Manage call flows, SIP interactions, and condition handling.
- **Python Modules**: Perform real-time speech recognition and utilize GPT for understanding and responding to user interactions.
- **Error Handling**: Efficiently manage and terminate loops based on error conditions or specific statuses.

## üí° How It Works

1. **SIP Call Initiation**: The system initiates a SIP call via FreeSWITCH, managed by Lua scripts.
2. **User Interaction**: The system captures user responses during the call using a speech recognition library.
3. **AI Analysis**: Responses are sent to Python, where GPT models analyze and provide insights for decision-making.
4. **Decision-Making**: The system adjusts the call flow based on analysis and specific conditions.
5. **Error Handling**: The system gracefully handles errors, breaking loops or terminating calls when necessary.

## üîß Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-telephony.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Configure FreeSWITCH**: Set up your SIP configurations and connect them with Lua scripts.
4. **Run the System**: Start the FreeSWITCH service and execute the main Lua script.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **FreeSWITCH**: SIP server for managing VoIP calls.
- **Lua**: Scripting language for call flow control.
- **Python**: Audio analysis with a speech recognition library and GPT integration for AI responses.

## üìà Roadmap

- **Enhanced AI Analysis**: Incorporate advanced NLP models for more detailed user interaction analysis.
- **Scalability Improvements**: Optimize the system for handling large volumes of calls concurrently.
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Further refine the error management system for more complex scenarios.
